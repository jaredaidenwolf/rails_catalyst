# RailsCatalyst

This Rails application template automates the setup process for new Rails projects. It includes a series of customizations and configurations that are commonly required for modern web applications. This includes:

- Setting up essential gems
- Configuring PostgreSQL for database management
- Initializing version control settings
- Creating environment variables
- Establishing a basic homepage with header partials

The goal is to accelerate the development process by pre-configuring repetitive setup tasks, allowing developers to focus on the unique aspects of their applications.
